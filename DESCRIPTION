Description: Includes functionality to estimate a multitaper coherence.  The coherence can be between a series and itself or two different series.  Coherence estimates can be done at 2 different frequencies if needed to create a spectrogram like plot.  Will estimate the transfer function between multiple inputs and a response in the frequency domain.
